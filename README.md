# AirHockey_Game

This is a Progressive Web Application which could be installed on your Desktop/Phones.

Controls for this game are pretty easy, as a player you need to mouseover with your Chuck (Player Object).
And try to hit the ball (Puck) on the other Player's goal post, whoever scores 10 goals first would win the game.

This application/game is built in using HTML, CSS, Javascript.
